# **Dynamic Particle Motion: Algorithmic vs. Machine Learning Approaches**

## **Overview**
This repository accompanies the research paper **"Algorithmic vs. Machine Learning Approaches for Solving Dynamic Particle Motion Problems"** by Munenyashaishe Hove. The paper explores the comparative performance of traditional algorithmic methods and machine learning (ML) techniques in simulating dynamic particle motion—an essential challenge in fields like physics, chemistry, and engineering.

The research investigates:
- Traditional algorithmic approaches, including Euler's Method, Verlet Integration, and Runge-Kutta.
- Advanced machine learning models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformer Models, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).

The goal of this work is to bridge the gap between algorithmic and machine learning methodologies, offering insights into their relative strengths and limitations for solving complex particle motion problems.

## **Paper Highlights**
### **Abstract**
Dynamic particle motion plays a crucial role in simulating and understanding complex systems across various scientific disciplines. Traditional algorithmic methods grounded in physical principles have been the standard solution for decades but face limitations when applied to nonlinear and chaotic systems. Machine learning offers a promising alternative, leveraging data-driven approaches to capture intricate patterns and behaviors. This paper compares the accuracy, efficiency, scalability, and robustness of traditional algorithms versus ML-based approaches using synthetic datasets, with a focus on practical applications in African industries such as energy and materials science.

### **Key Contributions**
1. **Comparative Analysis**: Evaluates algorithmic methods (Euler’s Method, Verlet Integration, Runge-Kutta) against ML models (RNNs, CNNs, Transformers, GNNs) for simulating dynamic particle motion.
2. **Performance Metrics**: Assesses accuracy, computational efficiency, scalability, and robustness for each approach.
3. **Relevance to Africa**: Explores how advancements in simulation techniques can address challenges in African industries, including energy and materials science.

### **Preliminary Observations**
- Traditional methods excel in well-defined, predictable systems but struggle with complex interactions.
- ML models show promise in handling chaotic environments but require extensive training data and computational resources.
- The research highlights the potential for hybrid approaches to leverage the strengths of both paradigms.
